### Multimodal Wristband for Real-Time Scratch Detection in Patients with Chronic Itch

### Summary
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition whose primary symptom is pruritus, or itch. This triggers a compulsive urge to scratch that results in skin damage, inflammation, and increased infection risk. Current patient assessments primarily rely on visual inspection and self-reporting, which are limited by subjectivity and low specificity, failing to accurately measure the frequency, intensity, and duration of itching episodes. This repository contains the software and hardware files invoved in the development of a wearable wristband designed to detect scratching behaviors in patients with chronic itch. The device utilizes accelerometer data to measure tendon movements in the wrist and capture arm motions and vibrations and capacitive sensing to detected variations in muscular activity during scratching, both being complementary. These data are transmitted wirelessly via Wi-Fi using the UDP protocol for real-time collection and analysis. The ultimate objective is to gather enough data from test subjects to train a machine learning algorithm for accurate scratch detection. The device is intented for future use in real life scenarios, therefore, the development of an app is also considered.

### Project sections
This project can be clearly defined in four sections:
1. Hardware Design

2. Software for data transmission and data collection

3. Machine learning algorithms

4. App Development
